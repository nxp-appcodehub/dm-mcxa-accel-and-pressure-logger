## 3-Axis Accelerometer and Pressure Sensor demo based on FRDM-MCXA153

- This demo shows how to configure the absolute pressure sensor MPL3115 (20 to 110 kPa) and the 3-axis accelerometer sensor FXLS8974CF (Â±2/4/8/16 g) by consuming the NXP Sensor ISSDK.
- The FXLS8974CF sensor is configured with the following settings.
  - FSR = 2g's (Full Scale Range)
  - Sensitivity of 0.98 mg/LSB. The Sensitivity depends on the FSR selected.
  - ODR = 6.25 Hz (Output Data Rate). Sensor Data Registers will be refreshed at a rate of 6.25Hz. This configuration results in low noise. The minimum ODR that can be set is 0.781 Hz, while the maximum is 3200 Hz.<br>
  
- The MPL3115 Absolute Pressure Sensor is configured with the following settings.
  - OSR = 2 (Output Sample Rate). The minimum Time Between Data Samples 10 ms.
  - Enable Data Ready and Event flags for Altitude, Temperature or either.
  - ALTITUDE or PRESSURE Mode depending on user selection (set Macro before compilation).

The demo consumes the captured data from XYZ axis of the accelerometer and processes those. See Results section. <br />

Refer to section 5 for more information about parts used for this demo.

## 1. Software<a name="step1"></a>
- IoT Sensing SDK (ISSDK) v1.8 offered as middleware in MCUXpresso SDK for supported platforms (https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/sensor-toolbox/iot-sensing-software-development-kit-issdk-embedded-software-framework:IOT-SENSING-SDK)
- [MCXUpresso SDK 2.14.0 for FRDM-MCXA153](https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/en/builder?hw=FRDM-MCXA153)
- [MCUXpresso IDE v11.9.0 or newer](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE)
- Git v2.39.0
- Teraterm (https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm/releases) or RealTerm (https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/)

## 2. Hardware<a name="step2"></a>
- [FRDM-MCXA153 board](https://www.nxp.com/part/FRDM-MCXA153)
- [Accel & Pressure click board](https://www.mikroe.com/accelpressure-click)
- Personal Computer
- Mini/micro C USB cable

## 3. Setup<a name="step3"></a>


### 3.1 Step 1: Download and Install required Software(s)
- Download and Install [MCUXpresso IDE 11.9.0 or newer](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE?&tid=vanMCUXPRESSO/IDE) and Install following the installer instructions.
- Download and Install [MCXUpresso SDK 2.14.0 or newer for FRDM-MCXA153](https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/en/builder?hw=FRDM-MCXA153) OR
- Install Git v2.39.0 or newer (for cloning and running west commands)
- Download and Install [RealTerm (for checking examples output)](https://osdn.net/projects/ttssh2/releases/)

### 3.2 Step 2: Clone the APP-CODE-HUB/dm-mcxa-accel-and-pressure-logger
- Open MCUXpresso IDE and select a directory to create your workspace.
- Install "MCXUpresso SDK 2.14.0 for FRDM-MCXA153" (drag and drop SDK zip into "Installed SDK" view) into MCUXpresso IDE.
- Click on "Import from Applications Code Hub" on QuickStart Panel to clone this demo directly.
- 
### 3.3 Step 3: Build example projects
- Once the project is imported, right click on its name and select build to start building.

### 3.4 Step 4: Run example projects
- Connect FRDM-MCXA153 with Accel&Pressure click board atop.
- Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link USB port on the target board.
- Right click on project and select "Debug As". Select MCUXpresso IDE LinkServer (inc. CMSIS DAP) probes.
- Open a serial terminal (RealTerm) with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
- Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

## 4. Results<a name="step4"></a>
- The GREEN LED will blink at low rate when the response of the Z axis is higher than 1.2g's, this behavior is easily observed when the user grabs the board on hands. Note that GREEN LED is directly related to Z axis.
- On the other hand, XY axis are related with the RED and BLUE LED's respectively. Tilting the board over X or Y axis will cause the RED and BLUE LED to blink at rate that is function of the detected g level.
- The demo is able to run in standalone mode. However, the only way to read out the Pressure/Altitude measurements from MPL3115 sensor is by attaching a Serial Terminal Application.
- The pressure measurements will be shown in Pascals (Pa), while the altitude will be shown in meters.
